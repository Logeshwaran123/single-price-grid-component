# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component

In this project, I have gained some confidence in building some CSS related concepts expecially working with CSS Grid. As a Beginner in CSS Grid I have understood the CSS GRID layout.

## Things I applied from my learning

1. CSS Grid Layout and have avoided unwanted flex box creation in the first step.
1. Have confidence in breaking the design and most importantly applying the responsiveness more intact way.üòé
1. This coding practice is very crucial for my web development career understanding the design is more important in building this kind of web components.

## CODE BLOCK I'm feeling nice

```
@media (max-width: 580px) {
  #root {
    /* Fonts or Typography */
    font-size: 12px;
    max-width: 280px;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }

  .note {
    padding: 1.45em;
  }

  h3.sub-headline {
    font-weight: 500;
    font-size: 1.25em;
  }
}
```
